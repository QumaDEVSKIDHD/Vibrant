/**
 * Manages in-game resources of the player (like for example sprinting). A module can - while the updateResources state - request, require,
 * enforce, disable or otherwise manipulate any resource of the player, that is tracked here. This prevents multiple modules from
 * concurrently setting different player resources to different values thus creating bugs. If a module urgently requires a resource that
 * is currently blocked by another module with lower priority, it can be reassigned to the new requesting module. On the other hand, if
 * a module requires a certain resource, that is disabled at the moment due to urgent work of another module with higher priority, the
 * first requesting module must wait for that resource and cannot perform its work (unless the resource is not mandatory). It is always
 * the module's responsibility to react to missing or suddenly vanishing resources properly.
